      <p> Welcome to this technical documentation page on Marvel movies. It isn't really technical, but I struggle with coming up with topics and this is the first thing I thought of.
      </p>
      <p> Marvel Comics, American media and entertainment company that was widely regarded as one of the “big two” publishers in the comic industry. Its parent company, Marvel Entertainment, is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Disney Company. Its headquarters are in New York City.
      </p>
      <p> Corporate History: The precursor to Marvel Comics was founded in 1939 by pulp magazine publisher Martin Goodman. In order to capitalize on the growing popularity of comic books—especially those starring superheroes—Goodman created Timely Comics. Timely’s first comic book was Marvel Comics no. 1 (cover dated October 1939), which featured several superhero characters, most notably the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner. Timely Comics introduced many superhero characters during comics’ “Golden Age” in the 1940s, most importantly Captain America, who first appeared in Captain America Comics no. 1 (March 1941).
      </p>
      <p>Timely characters were often portrayed as fighting against the Nazis and the Japanese even before the United States entered World War II. As the 1940s came to a close, superheroes fell out of vogue with comic book readers, and Timely canceled the last of its books in this genre in 1950. In 1951 Goodman formed his own distribution company, and Timely Comics became Atlas Magazines. Though there was a brief experiment in bringing back superheroes such as Captain America in 1953, Atlas’s output was mostly in other genres such as humour, westerns, horror, war, and science fiction.
      </p>
      <p> In 1956 rival company DC Comics ushered in the so-called Silver Age of comics by reintroducing superhero titles with significant commercial success. In the early 1960s Atlas changed its name to Marvel Comics. For several decades Marvel and DC were the top companies in the industry. Throughout the 1980s and ’90s Marvel changed hands numerous times, becoming a publicly held company in 1991. Questionable management decisions and a general slump in sales in the comic book industry drove Marvel Comics into bankruptcy in 1996. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 1998 and began to diversify its output, launching imprints aimed at a variety of demographics and expanding its cinematic offerings under the Marvel Studios banner. In 2007 Marvel began publishing digital comics. In 2009 the Walt Disney Company purchased the parent company of Marvel Comics.

      <p> Summary: The First Avenger (2011): Tony Stark made a spectacle of himself when he announced himself as Iron Man, but the real first superhero of the Marvel Cinematic Universe emerged back in the early 1940s during World War II, as featured in Joe Johnston's Captain America: The First Avenger. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is first shown to be a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who wants nothing more than the opportunity to fight for his country, but is repeatedly told he is unfit for service. His fortunes change, however, when he meets Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) and is given the Super Soldier Serum -- a chemical that transforms him into the heroic Captain America.
      </p>
      <p>
      While he is first used as just a propaganda tool, Steve proves his worth when he is able to rescue an entire battalion, including his best friend, Sgt. James "Bucky" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), and he winds up becoming one of the great heroes of the Great War. Unfortunately, this puts him in direct conflict with Erskine's former creation, Johann Schmidt a.k.a. The Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), the leader of the Nazi deep science division, Hydra. His weapons fueled by a cosmic device called The Tesseract, Red Skull has plans to drop bombs on all the world's capitals, but it's a plan that Steve is able to foil by crashing the carrier into the North Pole. He is presumed dead for decades, but the reality is that he is only frozen...

      <header>Spider Man Homecoming</header>
      <p>Summary: Young Peter Parker got a taste of the big time superhero life during the events of Captain America: Civil War, but Jon Watts' Spider-Man: Homecoming sees the web-slinging hero return to his more humdrum normal life. He is desperate to prove himself as good enough to join The Avengers, but Tony Stark -- who designed his suit -- refuses to let him off the leash. This is pretty unbearable, but things get even worse when Peter discovers a villainous plot involving the hijacking of alien and advanced technology from the government for the development of black market weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
      Spider-Man begins to look into the criminal behaviors of Adrian Toomes a.k.a. The Vulture (Michael Keaton), but simultaneously has to hide his secret life from his classmates and Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He fortunately has an ally in his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), and by the end of the film he is legitimately able to save the day -- stopping a plane loaded with Avengers equipment from being stolen by Toomes. It winds up being a hit to his social life, as his crush, Liz Allen (Laura Harrier), is actually the villain's daughter, but what Peter doesn't know is that his classmate Michelle a.k.a. M.J. (Zendaya) has a serious crush on him. He also very much grows from the experience, as he has the maturity to turn down Tony Stark's offer to join the Avengers, and instead remains a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
      </p>
      <ul> Spider Man is a great movie because:

      <p>Summary: Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Peyton Reed's Ant-Man hanging pretty close to the bottom rung of society. He has just been released from prison, and while he is a reformed criminal dedicated to doing right by his daughter, nobody will give him a chance. As a result, he is forced to act upon a tip from his former cellmate Luis (Michael Pena), and he decides to burgle the home of noted scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). Rather than finding any money or valuables, however, what he really gets is a second chance at life.
      </p>
      <p>
      As it turns out, Hank set up the entire burglary as a test, as he needs Scott's help. Hank's former protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), is close to discovering the secret behind his ultra-secretive shrinking technology, and he needs Scott to wear a specially designed Ant-Man suit to take it from him. With assistance from Hank's daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), Scott trains to shrink down to insect-size, and communicate with ants - all in hopes of sabotaging the unveiling of Cross' innovation. It's a successful mission in the end, and Scott finds permission to begin again as a hero.

      <p>Summary: Following the titular character's introduction in Captain America: Civil War, Ryan Coogler's Black Panther brings the regal and heroic T'Challa back home to the African nation of Wakanda. He is to be named king following the unexpected death of his father, T'Chaka (John Kani), and fortunately has the support of the Queen Mother, Ramonda (Angela Bassett), his genius younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), his bodyguard Okoye (Danai Gurira), and his secret love, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o). It seems like it should be smooth sailing ascending to the crown, but the situation proves anything but.
      </p>
      <p>T'Challa's coronation coincides with the arrival of Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) -- a foreign-born mercenary who also happens to be the son of T'Chaka's brother. Killmonger believes that the throne of Wakanda rightfully belongs to him, and he challenges T'Challa in ritual combat for the crown -- with visions of exporting Wakanda's immense resources to the rest of the world and starting a global war. It becomes a successful revolution, as Killmonger takes over the country, but with support from his people the Black Panther fights back. T'Challa is eventually able to rescue his nation from Killmonger's grip, but also learns something from his cousin's efforts. After centuries of isolation, he decides that it's time for Wakanda to open itself up to everybody.
